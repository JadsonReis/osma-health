# osma-health: OSM Analytics Health Module

osma-health is an independent extension of OSM Analytics for health campaigns run by HOT. The current phase is to understand the progress and completeness of Malaria campaigns.

This repository will be the main ticket tracker, as well as the front-end code. Other repos are:
* [osma-health-infra](https://github.com/hotosm/osma-health-infra) - private infrastructure code.
* [osmlint](https://github.com/hotosm/osmlint) - fork of OSMLint with validators specific for this project.

osma-health is being built by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/)
